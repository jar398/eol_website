# Utility for paginating Cypher queries.
# Writes pages to .csv files, then concatenates them all.
# Does rudimentary error recovery.
# Could be more parallel than it is.

# Writes to stdout if @path is nil

# If the script is interrupted, it can be run again and it will use
# files created on a previous run, if the previous run was in the same
# calendar month.  This is a time saving measure.

# Thanks to Bill Tozier (https://github.com/vaguery) for code review;

  # The query_fn takes a CQL query as input, executes it, and returns
  # a result set.  The result set is returned in the idiosyncratic
  # form delivered by neo4j.  The implementation of the query_fn might
  # use neography, or the EOL web API, or any other method for

  # supervise_query: generate a set of 'pages', then put them

  # A page is the result set of a single cypher query.  The queries
  # are in a single supervise_query call are all the same, except for
  # the value of the SKIP parameter.

  # The reason for this is that the result sets for some queries are
  # too big to capture with a single query, due to timeouts or other
  # problems.

  # Each page is placed in its own file.  If a page file already
  # exists the query is not repeated - the results from the previous
  # run are used directly without verification.
